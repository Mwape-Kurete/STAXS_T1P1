# Project Objectives & Requirements 
## Why Staxs & Reaching the Project Objectives
When presented with the project brief along with my deep interest in music, I thought that creating a React app for people who enjoy looking deeper into their favourite artists was the perfect fit. Staxs allows you to compare and view stats from all your favourite artists. You can even settle the Kendrick Lamar vs. Drake beef just by using Staxs and looking at the cold hard statistics. 

This choice allowed me to create an application that accurately and efficiently allowed users to: 
- create and compare 2 objects
- display information/data on those objects in 3 different charts
- Select an artist object who's:
      Top Tracks are then displayed
      Top Tracks Track features are visualised in a changeable timeline
- Update and change objects at any time 

## Project Requirements 
- Landing Page: 
    Dashboard 
- Compare Page:
    compare 2 objects
    use 3 different charts
    select/change objects
- Timeline Page
    Line Graph - 5 different properties
    display 1 property at a time 
    information should be changeable
